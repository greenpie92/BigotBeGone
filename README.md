A Blocklist for the browser addon BlockTube to eliminate as much right wing content from your feed

This blocklist is meant to block right wing content on YouTube and to make the process of cleaning up your Youtube feed much quicker.
I'm more than willing to add new entries in this list if folks want to point out new problematic content creators that I didn't know about or simply missed.
This list is very long, because I started this a few years ago, some of the channels are now dead, banned, or may have even changed.
But this list blocks the most popular right wing content creators to my knowledge and their backup channels plus any channels associated with them.
And for other channels, I used my best judgment, for example I blocked a number of "feminist cringe compilation" channels since that usually leads to more extreme content
